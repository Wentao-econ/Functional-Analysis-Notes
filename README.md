# Functional-Analysis-Notes
This repository contains my notes of Functional Analysis, which is an advanced course in mathematics.

These notes are still being updated on an irregular basis, primarily to supplement each chapter with high-quality exercises, refine certain details in the main text, and correct any typos or errors. (Currently, this set of notes is only available in Chinese; an English version will be uploaded within the next year.)
